I'm Joseph (Joey) Eremondi, post-doctoral researcher working with [Ohad Kammar](https://www.inf.ed.ac.uk/people/staff/Ohad_Kammar.html) at the University of Edinburgh.

Previously, I was a PhD candidate working with
[Ron Garcia](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~rxg/) at the
[UBC Software Practices Laboratory](https://spl.cs.ubc.ca/).

My research is centred around type systems for making code more
reliable, and in the theory and practice of making such systems easier
to use. In particular, I'm interested in dependent pattern matching,
mixing dependent types with
gradual types and improving error messages for dependently-typed
languages. I've also researched the properties of reversal-bounded
counter automata, set constraints, and the shuffle operator on words.
